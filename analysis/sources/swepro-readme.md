## News

(9/22) **SWE-Bench Pro V2 released.** 642 validated tasks in Harbor format under [`v2/`](v2/), the HARD-51 subset, and the locked-protocol tooling (offline agent phase, fresh-sandbox re-grading). The HuggingFace `default` config is now V2; v1 is kept as config `v1` / tag `v1.0`. See [`v2/README.md`](v2/README.md).

(05/18) We have identified some issues with the leaderboard and are currently working on addressing them. 

(2/9) We have removed some unit tests which were outdated (e.g. required the year 2025) or were previously not intended to be included. 

(1/7) We have fixed an issue with tutao instances where they take a long time to eval. The relevant run scripts are updated.

(10/28) We added mini-swe-agent! Results are comparable to SWE-Agent for Sonnet 4.5. Feel free to give it a shot. (credit @miguelrc-scale)

(10/28) We have the SWE-Agent scaffold to reproduce results and a step-by-step guide below. We have confirmed that this reproduces the Sonnet 4.5 results. (credit @18vijayb)

(10/3) We have updated results without cap limit here: https://scaleapi.github.io/SWE-bench_Pro-os/

## Overview
SWE-Bench Pro is a challenging benchmark evaluating LLMs/Agents on long-horizon software engineering tasks.
Given a *codebase* and an *issue*, a language model is tasked with generating a *patch* that resolves the described problem.

The dataset is inspired from SWE-Bench: https://github.com/SWE-bench/SWE-bench

To access SWE-bench Pro, copy and run the following code:
```python
from datasets import load_dataset
swebench = load_dataset('ScaleAI/SWE-bench_Pro', split='test')
```

## SWE-Bench Pro V2

V2 is the validated public split: **642 tasks across 11 repositories**, each shipped as a self-contained
[Harbor](https://github.com/laude-institute/harbor) task directory under [`v2/tasks/`](v2/tasks/) with its verifier,
reference solution and a public container image (`ghcr.io/scaleapi/swe-bench_pro-v2:<instance_id>`), plus the
**HARD-51** subset ([`v2/hard51_ids.txt`](v2/hard51_ids.txt)) and the locked-protocol tooling ([`v2/tooling/`](v2/tooling/)).
Full instructions: [`v2/README.md`](v2/README.md).

```python
from datasets import load_dataset
v2   = load_dataset('ScaleAI/SWE-bench_Pro', split='test')            # V2, 642 tasks (default config)
hard = load_dataset('ScaleAI/SWE-bench_Pro', 'hard', split='test')    # HARD-51
v1   = load_dataset('ScaleAI/SWE-bench_Pro', 'v1', split='test')      # original 731 tasks
```

```bash
harbor run -p v2/tasks -e modal -n 50 -a oracle        # reference patch resolves 642/642
```

Everything below this section (`swe_bench_pro_eval.py`, `run_scripts/`, `dockerfiles/`, the Docker Hub images) is the
**v1 pipeline**, kept for reproducing v1 numbers with the `v1` config.

## Installation

### 1. Install Python Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Install Docker

SWE-bench Pro uses Docker for reproducible evaluations.

Follow the instructions in the [Docker setup guide](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) to install Docker on your machine.
If you're setting up on Linux, we recommend seeing the [post-installation steps](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/) as well.

### 3. Configure Modal (Recommended) (or use local docker [Beta])

```bash
modal setup  # Follow the prompts to generate your token
```

After running, verify your credentials in `~/.modal.toml`:
```
token_id = <token id>
token_secret = <token secret>
active = true
```

Beta: Local Docker. No additional setup needed. Use the `--use_local_docker` flag when running evaluations.

## Docker Images

**V2:** every task's image is public on GitHub Container Registry and referenced by the `docker_image` column
(`ghcr.io/scaleapi/swe-bench_pro-v2:<instance_id>`); `docker pull` needs no login.

**v1 (legacy):** we provide prebuilt Docker images for each v1 instance on Docker Hub:

**Repository:** https://hub.docker.com/r/jefzda/sweap-images

### Finding the Correct Image

Each instance in the HuggingFace dataset has a `dockerhub_tag` column containing the Docker tag for that instance. You can access it directly:

```python
from datasets import load_dataset

dataset = load_dataset('ScaleAI/SWE-bench_Pro', split='test')

# Get the Docker image for a specific instance
for row in dataset:
    instance_id = row['instance_id']
    docker_tag = row['dockerhub_tag']
    full_image = f"jefzda/sweap-images:{docker_tag}"
    print(f"{instance_id} -> {full_image}")
```

**Important:** Bash runs by default in our images. When running these images, you should not manually invoke bash. See https://github.com/scaleapi/SWE-bench_Pro-os/issues/6

## Usage

### 1. Generate Patches
Generate patch predictions using your harness of choice. 

For generating patches using SWE-agent, see the [SWE-agent git submodule](./SWE-agent/) (note: you will have to use this as a git submodule. See [official git documentation](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules) for details). The submodule contains detailed instructions to
- Set up SWE-agent for patch generation
- Run SWE-agent on SWE-Bench Pro instances
- Configure model parameters and turn limits

The output will be `.pred` files containing model-generated patches for each instance.

### 2. Gather Patches
After generating patches, use the `gather_patches.py` helper script to collect all patches into a single JSON file for evaluation:

```bash
python helper_code/gather_patches.py \
    --directory <path_to_pred_files> \
    --prefix <model_name> \
    --output <output_file>.json
```

**Parameters:**
- `--directory`: Directory containing instance folders with `.pred` files (e.g., from SWE-agent output or downloaded trajectories)
- `--prefix`: Prefix identifier for your model/run (e.g., "gpt4", "claude-sonnet", "sample1")
- `--output`: Output JSON file path

**Example:**
```bash
python helper_code/gather_patches.py \
    --directory swe_bench_pro_results/sample1 \
    --prefix sample1 \
    --output sample1_patches.json
```

This will create a JSON file in the format expected by the evaluation script:
```json
[
  {
    "instance_id": "instance_...",
    "patch": "diff --git ...",
    "prefix": "sample1"
  }
]
```

### 3. Evaluate Patches

Evaluate patch predictions on SWE-Bench Pro:

```bash
python swe_bench_pro_eval.py \
    --raw_sample_path=swe_bench_pro_full.csv \
    --patch_path=<your_patches>.json \
    --output_dir=<output_directory> \
    --scripts_dir=run_scripts \
    --num_workers=100 \
    --dockerhub_username=jefzda
```

You can test with the gold patches, which are in the HuggingFace dataset. There is a helper script in `helper_code` which can extract the gold patches into the required JSON format.

## Reproducing Leaderboard Results

To reproduce leaderboard results end-to-end, follow the following steps:

1. Complete setup in the `SWE-agent` submodule. We recommend to use the Docker image to run the scaffold, via `just`.
2. Run the scaffold. We have included an example for Claude Sonnet 4.5 (claude.yaml) but feel free to use any model. It also supports `vllm` for local models. Note that we recommend using the DockerHub images rather than building the Docker images from scratch. You can also execute it locally without Modal.
3. Compile predictions with helper_code/gather_patches.py.
4. Run the evaluation script `swe_bench_pro_eval.py` to run the evaluation script.
